1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales, customer,
   product, and delivery behavior.

2. Apply descriptive statistics to summarize revenue, demand, and delivery
   performance.

3. Test statistical hypotheses to evaluate relationships between key variables
   such as price vs quantity and order size vs delivery time.

4. Build a time-series model to forecast future sales and evaluate its
   reliability using residual diagnostics.

5. Train machine learning models to predict:
   a) Product demand
   b) Delivery time

6. Segment customers based on purchasing behavior using clustering techniques.

7. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and diagnostic tests.

8. Prepare ML-ready datasets that align with business decision-making for
   sales planning, inventory optimization, marketing, and logistics.
