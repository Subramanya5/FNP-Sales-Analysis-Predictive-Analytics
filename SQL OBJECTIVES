#Total Orders
-- Determine the total number of unique orders placed in the system to measure order volume and transaction activity.

#Top-selling Products
-Identify the highest-performing products based on total revenue to understand product contribution and sales concentration.

#Monthly Revenue
 Analyse revenue trends monthly to detect seasonality, growth patterns, and occasion-driven sales spikes.

#Average Delivery Time

#Product Demand Prediction Dataset
-- Create a product-level dataset incorporating quantity sold, pricing, temporal attributes, and occasion information to support demand prediction models.

#Delivery Time Prediction Dataset
-- Build an order-level dataset capturing delivery duration, order characteristics, location, and time attributes for delivery delay prediction modelling.

#Location-wise Delivery Performance
-- Compare delivery performance across locations to identify regions with consistent delays or operational inefficiencies.

#Price vs Quantity (Elasticity Check)
-- analyse the relationship between product price and quantity sold to evaluate price sensitivity and demand elasticity.

#Occasion-wise Spending Analysis
